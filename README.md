# Mega Trivia X

How well do you know the Mega Man X series?  

## Motivation

The purpose of this was to learn how to implement timed events with javascript/jQuery, as well as DOM manipulation. These actions are some of the fundamental asepcts of nearly all web applications, DOM manipulation more so than timed events. Though it is not _always_ necessary to have DOM manipulation in a web application, any self-respecting web developer should at least know how to implement it in some shape or form.
